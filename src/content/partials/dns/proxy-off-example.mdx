When a browser initiates an HTTP/HTTPS request to `shop.example.com`, a DNS resolver will convert the hostname into an IP address. Since this domain is using Cloudflare as its authoritative DNS provider, the DNS query will be routed to Cloudflare; but since the proxy is off (that is, **DNS only**), Cloudflare will answer with `192.0.2.2`. Finally, the browser initiates an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server hosted at `192.0.2.2`.
