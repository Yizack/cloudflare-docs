## Performance charecteristics
Pipelines are performant up to the following limits:
- 20,000 requests per second
- 20 MB / s.

Consistently exceeding these limits will result may result in requests being rejected by your Pipeline, with a status code of 429, indicating that your Pipeline is unable to keep up with the volume.

These performance limits apply simultaneously. For example, if you are sending 100 byte records, you can safely make up to 20,000 requests per second. However, if you are sending 1 MB records, you will only be able to make 20 requests per second.
