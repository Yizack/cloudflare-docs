Pipelines support ingesting data via HTTP. When you create a new Pipeline, you'll receive an HTTP endpoint that you can make post requests to.


```sh
$ npx wrangler pipelines create [PIPELINE-NAME] --r2 [R2-BUCKET-NAME] --access-key-id [ACCESS-KEY-ID] --secret-access-key [SECRET-ACCESS-KEY]

ðŸŒ€ Creating pipeline named "[PIPELINE-NAME]"
âœ… Successfully created pipeline [PIPELINE-NAME] with ID [PIPELINE-ID]

You can now send data to your pipeline with:
  curl "https://<PIPELINE-ID>.pipelines.cloudflare.com/" -d '[{ ...JSON_DATA... }]'
```

## Turning HTTP ingestion off
By default, ingestion via HTTP is turned on for all Pipelines. You can turn it off by setting `--http false` when creating or updating a Pipeline.

```sh
$ npx wrangler pipelines create [PIPELINE-NAME] --r2 [R2-BUCKET-NAME] --access-key-id [ACCESS-KEY-ID] --secret-access-key [SECRET-ACCESS-KEY] --http false
```

Ingestion URLs are tied to your Pipeline ID. Turning HTTP off, and then turning it back on, will not change the URL.

## Authentication
You can secure your HTTP ingestion endpoint using Cloudflare API tokens. By default, authentication is turned off. To enable authentication, use `--authentication true` while creating or updating a Pipeline.

```
$ npx wrangler pipelines create [PIPELINE-NAME] --r2 [R2-BUCKET-NAME] --access-key-id [ACCESS-KEY-ID] --secret-access-key [SECRET-ACCESS-KEY] --authentication true
```

Once authentication is turned on, you will need to include a Cloudflare API token in your request headers.

### Get API token
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Navigate to your [API Keys](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
3. Select *Create Token*
4. Choose the template for Workers Pipelines. Click on *continue to summary*, and finally on *create token*. Make sure to copy the API token, and save it securely.

### Making authenticated requests
Include the API token you created in the previous step in the headers for your request:

```sh
curl https://<PIPELINE-ID>.pipelines.cloudflare.com
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
	-d '[
  		{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"},
  		{"key1": "value3", "key2": "value4"}
			]'
```
