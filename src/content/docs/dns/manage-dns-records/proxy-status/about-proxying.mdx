The **Proxy status** of a DNS record affects how Cloudflare treats incoming traffic to that record.


### Proxied records

When you proxy DNS records through Cloudflare — specifically [A, AAAA, or CNAME records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) — Cloudflare responds with an [anycast IP address](/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/) **instead of** the value defined on your [DNS table](/dns/manage-dns-records/#dns-records-table). This means that all requests intended for proxied hostnames will go to Cloudflare first and then be forwarded to your origin server.

```

This behavior allows Cloudflare to [optimize, cache, and protect](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) all requests to your application, as well as protect your origin server from [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

Cloudflare recommends enabling our proxy for all [A, AAAA, and CNAME](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) records that are used for serving web traffic. Refer to [Proxied DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/proxy-status/proxied-records/) for details and expected behavior.

### DNS-only records

When an A, AAAA, or CNAME record is **DNS-only** (also known as being gray-clouded), DNS queries for this record will resolve to the record's normal IP address.

In addition to potentially exposing your origin IP addresses to bad actors and [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), leaving your records as **DNS-only** means that Cloudflare cannot [optimize, cache, and protect](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) requests to your application or provide analytics on those requests.
