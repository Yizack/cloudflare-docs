:::caution[TEMP WIP NOTE]
Not too sure about the name. The idea would be to document any "expected behavior" for proxied records here

More details of how the DNS record proxy status interacts with other Cloudflare configurations. Besides content below (pulled from previously existing page), things like O2O, BYOIP address maps, etc, could go here.
:::

## Predefined time to live


By default, all [proxied records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) have a TTL of **Auto**, which is set to 300 seconds.

Since only [IP resolution records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) can be proxied, this setting ensures that queries to your domain name resolve fairly quickly. This setting also means that any changes to proxied `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records will take place within five minutes or less.

:::note


It may take longer than 5 minutes for you to actually experience record changes, as your local DNS cache may take longer to update.


:::

## Mix proxied and unproxied

If you have multiple `A/AAAA` records on the same name and at least one of them is proxied, Cloudflare will treat all `A/AAAA` records on this name as being proxied.

## Protocol optimization

For proxied records, if your domain has [HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled](/speed/optimization/protocol/), Cloudflare automatically generates corresponding [HTTPS Service (HTTPS) records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#svcb-and-https) on the fly. HTTPS records allow you to provide a client with information about how it should connect to a server upfront, without the need of an initial plaintext HTTP connection.

:::note
Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 configurations also require that you have an SSL/TLS certificate served by Cloudflare. This means that disabling [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), for example, could impact this behavior.
:::

## IP addresses

:::caution[Note to self]
Consider not going into detail about ingress vs egress here. Maybe a better option would be making note of that while mentioning Address Maps in cloudflare-configuration.mdx
:::


Because requests to proxied hostnames go through Cloudflare before reaching your origin server, all requests will appear to be coming from Cloudflare's IP addresses (and could potentially be blocked or rate limited). If you use proxied records, you may need to adjust your server configuration to [allow Cloudflare IPs](/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/).

Cloudflare anycast IPs used to proxy traffic on your domain are assigned automatically. These IPs might change at any time for operational reasons.
If you need to allowlist Cloudflare IPs on your infrastructure or hosting provider, include the full list of [Cloudflare anycast IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).

As an Enterprise customer, you have the option to get [static IPs](/spectrum/about/static-ip/) or [bring your own IPs (BYOIP)](/byoip/).
