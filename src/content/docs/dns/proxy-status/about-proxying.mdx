While your [DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/) are used to make your website or application available to visitors and other web services, the **Proxy status** of a DNS record is used to define how Cloudflare treats incoming traffic to that record.

The records you can proxy through Cloudflare are [IP address resolution records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) — meaning A, AAAA, or CNAME records. Cloudflare recommends enabling our proxy for all A, AAAA, and CNAME records that are used for serving web traffic.

### Proxied records

When you set a DNS record to **Proxied**, Cloudflare can:

- Protect your origin server from [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).
- [Optimize, cache, and protect](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/connect-your-domain/#domain-configurations) all requests to your application.
- Apply your configurations for a variety of [Cloudflare products](/dns/proxy-status/cloudflare-configuration/).

Apart from that, proxied DNS records have specific predefined fields and expected behavior — refer to [Proxied records](/dns/manage-dns-records/proxy-status/proxied-records/) for details.

To understand how Cloudflare responds to requests for proxied records, consider [How proxying works](/dns/proxy-status/about-proxying/#how-proxying-works) below.

### DNS-only records

When an A, AAAA, or CNAME record is **DNS-only** (also known as being gray-clouded), DNS queries for this record will resolve to the record's normal IP address.

In addition to potentially exposing your origin IP addresses to bad actors and [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), leaving your records as **DNS-only** means that:

- Cloudflare cannot [optimize, cache, and protect](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/connect-your-domain/#domain-configurations) requests to your domain.
- Cloudflare cannot provide analytics on those requests.
- Your configuration for a variety of [Cloudflare products](/dns/proxy-status/cloudflare-configuration/) will not be applied.

## How proxying works

```

When you set a DNS record to **Proxied**, Cloudflare responds with an [anycast IP address](/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/) **instead of** the value defined on your [DNS table](/dns/manage-dns-records/#dns-records-table). This means that all requests intended for proxied hostnames will go to Cloudflare first and then be forwarded to your origin server.
