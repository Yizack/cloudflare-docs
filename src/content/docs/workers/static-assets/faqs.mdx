### What's happening to [Pages](/pages/)?

Pages is fully supported, with no current plans to change its support status. That being said, new features will land in Workers without a guarantee they will be available in Pages.

### What kinds of projects are Workers best for, and when should I use Pages?

We currently recommend:

- **Pages** for static sites or simple applications (such as personal blogs or websites).
- **Workers** for building both static sites _and_ full stack applications, since you can take advantage of the full developer platform (such as [Queues](/queues/get-started/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and more). See the [Workers vs Pages compatibility matrix](/workers/static-assets/compatibility-matrix/) for more information.

### What about Workers Sites?

We do not recommend using Workers Sites for projects. Please use Workers with static assets, or Pages.
