### What's happening to [Pages](/pages/)?

Pages is fully supported, with no current plans to change its support status. That being said, new features will land in Workers without a guarantee they will be available in Pages.

### What about Workers Sites?

We do not recommend using Workers Sites for projects. Please use Workers with static assets, or Pages.
