[Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) now supports the direct upload and management of [static assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/), allowing teams to deliver complete solutions to their users. Workers for Platforms allows any organization to make their applications programmable, by embedding serverless functions directly into their products. This means that if you're using Workers for Platforms, you can allow other end-users to write and execute custom code within your system, without needing to worry about infrastructure, security, or performance. Workers for Platforms is commonly used by SaaS businesses ([such as Shopify](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-for-platforms/)) in order to give end-users granular control to extend the platform to meet their needs. 

With the support for static assets in Workers for Platforms, your organization's infrastructure is even more programmable and unified: 

+ **Host and serve static assets**: Upload and deliver static files (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) alongside your Workers, directly from Cloudflare's global edge network. 

+ **Optimize performance**: Reduce latency and improve user experience by co-locating static assets and dynamic Workers close to end-users. 

+ **Streamline Workflows**: Manage static assets and Workers in a single deployment flow, with manifest-based uploads to avoid redundant file transfers. 

+ **Enhance customization**: Leverage [asset bindings](/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding) in your Workers to dynamically fetch, modify, or customize static content.
